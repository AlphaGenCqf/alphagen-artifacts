Evolutionary Market Intelligence — Self-Adaptive Quantitative Systems
Overview

Evolutionary Market Intelligence is a research framework for studying how
quantitative trading systems adapt, evolve, and reorganize under
non-stationary market regimes. It models adaptation as a constrained,
regime-dependent evolutionary process rather than unconstrained learning
or optimization.

This directory serves as the artifact anchor for research papers on
self-adaptive quantitative systems within the AlphaGen research program.

Purpose

Most adaptive trading systems rely on continuous optimization or opaque
learning mechanisms that become unstable under regime change.

Evolutionary Market Intelligence reframes adaptation as:

conditional on diagnosed regime structure

constrained by market stability and stress

governed by explicit evolutionary rules

The objective is controlled adaptation, not unrestricted optimization.

Core Concepts

The framework studies adaptation through several key mechanisms:

Regime-Conditioned Evolution — strategy evolution occurs only within
admissible regime states

Selective Pressure — regimes impose survival constraints on strategy
forms

Population Dynamics — strategies are treated as populations rather
than isolated models

Extinction and Emergence — strategy failure and genesis are explicit
evolutionary outcomes

Adaptation is diagnostic-driven and structurally constrained.

Relationship to AlphaGen Frameworks

Evolutionary Market Intelligence operates downstream of diagnostic layers:

PDRC defines regime identity and transition structure

Market Physiology characterizes stress and compression states

BRD measures belief-driven instability affecting strategy survival

AlphaGen Architecture governs how evolutionary adaptation is applied
to live decision systems

Cognitive Womb provides conceptual grounding for strategy genesis

No evolutionary process bypasses regime diagnostics.

Artifact Scope

This directory may include:

Formal definitions of evolutionary operators

Strategy population schemas

Regime-conditioned adaptation rules

Experimental diagnostics and summaries

Reference implementations (non-production)

It does not include:

Live trading strategies

Performance benchmarks

Alpha, Sharpe, or optimization claims

Scientific Scope and Limitations

This framework makes no claims regarding predictive superiority or
profitability. Its contribution is methodological: a disciplined approach
to adaptation under regime uncertainty.
