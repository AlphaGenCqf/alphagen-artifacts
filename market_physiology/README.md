Market Physiology — Regime Compression & Structural Stress
Overview

Market Physiology is a diagnostic research framework that studies how
financial markets behave under structural stress, regime compression, and
loss of adaptive diversity. It treats markets as living systems whose
functional capacity degrades in identifiable ways during extreme
conditions.

This directory serves as the artifact anchor for research on regime
compression, instability, and stress-driven market behavior within the
AlphaGen research program.

Purpose

Standard financial models often treat stress as an exogenous shock.
Market Physiology instead examines stress as an endogenous structural
process in which regime diversity collapses and market behavior becomes
constrained.

The framework aims to diagnose:

when markets lose adaptive flexibility

how regimes compress under stress

how recovery dynamics differ from stable regimes

Core Concepts

Key physiological concepts studied in this framework include:

Regime Compression — reduction in the number of active structural
regimes under stress

Structural Rigidity — persistence of constrained behavior despite
changing conditions

Adaptive Capacity Loss — diminished response diversity

Stress Recovery Dynamics — asymmetry between breakdown and recovery

These phenomena are treated as diagnostic signals, not predictive targets.

Relationship to AlphaGen Frameworks

Market Physiology operates downstream of regime diagnostics:

PDRC identifies regime identity and transitions

Market Physiology characterizes structural behavior within and across
regimes under stress

BRD measures belief instability during physiological breakdown

AlphaGen Architecture constrains system behavior during compressed
states

This framework complements, but does not replace, regime classification.

Artifact Scope

This directory may include:

Definitions and metrics for regime compression

Stress-period diagnostics and summaries

Event-study artifacts and visualizations

Cross-regime physiological comparisons

Reference implementations (non-production)

It does not include:

Trading strategies

Stress-testing for performance

Risk forecasts or optimization results

Scientific Scope and Limitations

Market Physiology makes no claims regarding market prediction or
profitability. Its contribution is diagnostic: identifying structural
breakdown, constraint formation, and recovery patterns in non-stationary
markets.
