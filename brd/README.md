Belief–Reality Divergence (BRD)
Overview

Belief–Reality Divergence (BRD) is a diagnostic framework for measuring the
degree of mismatch between market participant beliefs and realized market
structure. It treats financial markets as cognitive systems in which
instability emerges when belief formation diverges from observable reality.

This directory serves as the artifact anchor for BRD-related research
papers and diagnostics within the AlphaGen research stack.

Purpose

Traditional market models focus on prices and volatility while ignoring
belief dynamics that drive regime instability.

BRD addresses this gap by quantifying divergence between:

inferred market beliefs (expectations, positioning proxies, narrative
pressure), and

realized market structure (regimes, risk pressure, continuity, stress).

The framework is diagnostic, not predictive.

Conceptual Definition

Belief–Reality Divergence is defined as a structured discrepancy between
belief-driven signals and empirically observed market states.

High BRD values indicate:

cognitive stress in the market

unstable regime persistence

elevated transition risk

Low BRD values indicate:

belief alignment with structural market conditions

regime stability

Relationship to AlphaGen Frameworks

BRD operates as a conditional diagnostic layer within the AlphaGen
ecosystem:

PDRC provides regime identity and stability context

BRD measures divergence conditional on regime state

AlphaGen Architecture uses BRD to constrain decision logic

Evolutionary Market Intelligence adapts strategies under BRD pressure

BRD does not operate independently of regime diagnostics.

Artifact Scope

This directory may include:

Formal definitions of belief and reality proxies

BRD computation specifications

Diagnostic visualizations and summaries

Reference implementations (non-production)

Regime-conditioned BRD analyses

It does not include:

Trading signals

Forecasting models

Performance or profitability metrics

Scientific Scope and Limitations

BRD makes no claims regarding prediction, alpha generation, or execution
efficiency. Its contribution is diagnostic: identifying conditions under
which belief-driven instability is structurally likely.
