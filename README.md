# AlphaGen Research Artifacts

This repository contains reproducible research artifacts, diagnostic frameworks, and methodological outputs developed by the **AlphaGen Institute for Cognitive & Quantitative Finance Research**.

All materials hosted here are designed to support **auditability, transparency, and peer inspection** in adaptive and non-stationary financial research.

---

## Institutional Identity

AlphaGen operates as an **independent research institute**, structurally separated from commercial execution, signal monetization, or brokerage incentives.

Research outputs are:
- Reproducible by design
- Auditable at the model and assumption level
- Suitable for academic and reviewer-centric evaluation

This repository represents the **artifact layer** of AlphaGen’s research program.

## Research Philosophy

Financial markets are treated not as static statistical processes, but as **cognitive systems** shaped by:
- Belief formation
- Feedback loops
- Regime transitions
- Structural instability

Accordingly, AlphaGen focuses on frameworks that diagnose *when* and *why* models fail, rather than optimizing performance within assumed stationarity.

## Core Research Domains

- Cognitive finance and belief–reality divergence  
- Regime diagnostics and market stability analysis  
- Adaptive quantitative and algorithmic systems  
- Audit-grade modeling standards and reproducibility protocols  

---

## Flagship Frameworks

### Cognitive Womb Framework
A conceptual research construct describing the generative conditions under which adaptive strategies emerge within regime-conditioned market environments.

Focus areas include:
- Strategy birth and decay
- Regime fitness landscapes
- Structural constraints on adaptation

### Belief–Reality Divergence (BRD)
A diagnostic framework formalizing the separation between internal belief states and realized market conditions, used to study instability, fragility, and regime transitions.

## Repository Structure (Evolving)

This repository will be organized into framework-specific directories, each containing:
- Formal definitions
- Assumption audits
- Reproducible experiments
- Diagnostic visualizations
- Documentation suitable for peer review

Structure will evolve conservatively to preserve traceability.

## Relationship to Other AlphaGen Assets

- **Institute Website:**  
  https://alphagencqf.github.io/alphagen-institute/

- **Primary Codebases:**  
  Referenced selectively, not mirrored, to avoid execution coupling.

---

## Citation & Use

This repository is intended for:
- Academic reference
- Methodological inspection
- Collaborative research development

Commercial reuse without attribution or structural integrity is discouraged.

Formal citation guidelines will be published as the framework matures.
