# Experiment 01 — Regime Timeline Construction

## Purpose
This experiment establishes the baseline empirical output of the
Parameter-Dominance Regime Classifier (PDRC).

The objective is strictly diagnostic:
to illustrate the regime timelines generated by PDRC when applied
to a real financial market, and to compare these timelines with
standard probabilistic regime-switching benchmarks.

No predictive, trading, or performance claims are made.

---

## Research Question
What discrete market regimes does PDRC identify over time, and how do
these regime timelines compare to those produced by commonly used
statistical regime-switching models?

---

## Data
- Market: S&P 500 equity index
- Frequency: Daily
- Period: 2004–2024
- Source: Publicly available market price data

All data used in this experiment are provided in the `data/` directory
or derived deterministically from those data.

---

## Methods
PDRC constructs market regimes based on dominance ordering among a fixed
set of empirically observable state parameters capturing structural
market dimensions (e.g., shock intensity, continuity, risk pressure,
participation, and temporal compression).

At each time step:
1. State parameters are estimated using rolling-window transformations.
2. Parameters are normalized to ensure comparability.
3. The dominant parameter determines the active regime.
4. Regime transitions occur when the dominance ordering changes.

For contextual comparison, regime timelines are also generated using:
- A two-state Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- A Markov-Switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) model

Benchmark models are used for reference only and do not influence
PDRC regime construction.

---

## Outputs
This experiment produces:
- A discrete PDRC regime label for each observation date
- Corresponding regime timelines for HMM and MS-GARCH benchmarks
- A comparative visualization of regime timelines

Outputs are provided as:
- CSV files containing regime labels
- A figure illustrating regime timelines across models

---

## Interpretation
The resulting timelines demonstrate that PDRC yields:
- Multiple interpretable regimes rather than latent statistical states
- Structurally distinct regime phases aligned with observable dominance
  shifts
- Clear and reproducible regime boundaries

This experiment establishes the empirical object upon which subsequent
analyses (transition timing, volatility response, persistence, and
robustness) are built.

---

## Non-Claims
This experiment does NOT:
- Forecast prices or volatility
- Generate trading signals
- Evaluate investment performance
- Optimize portfolios

Its role is limited to regime identification and structural diagnostics.

---

## Status
Experiment status: complete  
Role in paper: foundational empirical illustration (Figure 1)

Subsequent experiments build upon these regime timelines but are
conceptually independent of this experiment’s construction.
